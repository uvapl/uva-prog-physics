### Basics Exercises

The following exercises are not required, but will help you through this week's homework. Read the introduction to the assignments first.

* Define a function that uses another function. Make the second function's name an argument of the first function.
* Calculate the step size `dx` for a range of 0-10 in 50 steps.
* Calculate the number of steps for a range of 0-10 and a step size of 0.02.
* Define a function that adds the values of $$f(x)=x^2$$ in the range 0-1. Use a `for` loop.
* Generate a random number between 5 and 8 using the function `random()`.
* Use a `for` loop to find the maximum of the function $$f(x)=x^2$$ in the range 0-1.
