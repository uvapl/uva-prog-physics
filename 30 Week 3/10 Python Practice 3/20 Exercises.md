# Exercises

**Important**: most of these exercises should be put in a file called
`homework3.py`. You should make sure this file immediately runs and gives
correct output for every exercise. The same goes for all other files you
submit.

## 3.0 Quadratic Formula

Write a function roots that computes the roots of a quadratic equation. Check
for [complex roots] and print an error message saying that the roots are
complex.

[complex roots]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root#Square_roots_of_negative_and_complex_numbers

* Hint 1: Your function should take three parameters. What are they?
* Hint 2: We know the roots are complex when what condition about the
  discriminant is met?

**Important**. Be sure to use a variety of test cases, that include complex
roots, real roots, and double roots.

Optional: For an extra challenge, compute and print out the complex roots.
Python can natively handle complex numbers: [reference].

## 3.1 The game of Nims/Stones

In this game, two players sit in front of a pile of 100 stones. They take
turns, each removing between 1 and 5 stones (assuming there are at least 5
stones left in the pile). The person who removes the last stone(s) wins.

Because this game is interactive, put it in a separate file named `nims.py`.
Do create a function called `play_nims`, as follows:

	def play_nims(pile, max_stones):
		'''
		An interactive two-person game; also known as Stones.
		@param pile: the number of stones in the pile to start
		@param max_stones: the maximum number of stones you can take on one turn
		'''

Check out the lines of text in between the sets of `'''`, underneath the
definition. This is called a *docstring*, and is handy to use to tell other
programmers what parameters to pass in, and what your program does.

**First**, add a docstring to the function you wrote in the previous problem.

In this problem, you'll write a function to play this game; we've outlined it
for you. It may seem tricky, so break it down into parts. Like many programs,
we have to use nested loops (one loop inside another). In the outermost loop,
we want to keep playing until we are out of stones. Inside that, we want to
keep alternating players. You have the option of either writing two blocks of
code, or keeping a variable that tracks the current player. The second way
could be slightly trickier, but it's definitely do-able!

Finally, we might want to have an innermost loop that checks if the user's
input is valid. Is it a number? Is it a valid number (e.g. between 1 and 5)?
Are there enough stones in the pile to take off this many? If any of these
answers are no, we should tell the user and re-ask them the question.

As always, feel free to ask the assistants for help on any part of this
problem.

If you choose to write two blocks of code, the basic outline of the program
should be something like this:

	while [pile is not empty]:
		while [player 1's answer is not valid]:
			[ask player 1]
		[execute player 1's move]
		[same as above for player 2]

Be careful with the validity checks. Specifically, we want to keep asking
player 1 for their choice as long as their answer is not valid, BUT we want to
make sure we ask them at least ONCE. So, for example, we will want to keep a
variable that tracks whether their answer is valid, and set it to False
initially.

When you're finished, test each other's programs by playing them!

## 3.2 Report Card with GPA

Write a function report card where the user can enter each of his grades,
after which the program prints out a report card with GPA ([Urban
dictionary]). Remember to ask the user how many classes he took. Think: why
would we need to ask this? Could we write the program a different way, which
wouldn't need that info? Example output is below.

The function should take a list of tuples as its input.

[Urban dictionary]: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gpa

	>>> report_card([('18.02, 94), ('21H.601', 96), ('8.01', 91), ('5.111', 88)])
	REPORT CARD:
	18.02 - 94
	21H.601 - 96
	8.01 - 91
	5.111 - 88
	Overall GPA  92.25

Hints: You'll want to use a for loop, and you'll probably want to keep track
of names and grades seperately; there are a couple ways to do this. Remember,
add to lists with `my_list.append(elt)`.

## 3.3 Collision Detection of Balls

Many games have complex physics engines, and one major function of these
engines is to figure out if two objects are colliding. Weirdly-shaped objects
are often approximated as balls. In this problem, we will figure out if two
balls are colliding. You'll need to remember how to unpack tuples; refer to
the Tuples chapter in *Think Python* or ask an assistant if this is confusing.

We will think in 2D to simplify things, though 3D isn't different
conceptually. For calculating collision, we only care about a ball's position
in space, as well as its size. We can store a ball's position with the $(x,y)$
coordinates of its center point, and we can calculate its size if we know its
radius. Thus, we represent a ball in 2D space as a tuple of $(x, y, r)$.

To figure out if two balls are colliding, we need to compute the distance
between their centers, then see if this distance is less than or equal to the
sum of their radii. If so, they are colliding.

In `homework3.py`, write a function `ball_collide` that takes two balls as
parameters and computes if they are colliding; your function should return a
Boolean saying whether or not the balls are colliding. Optional: For a little
extra challenge, write your function to work with balls in 3D space. How
should you represent the balls? You will also need to write your own test
cases. Be sure to figure out any edge cases you need to test.

## 3.5 Zeller's Algorithm, revisited

This is similar to the Hacker exercise from Week 1, but in this version we
will be writing a function that takes parameters, and using dictionaries to
facilitate "pretty printing" (where the answer is given to the user in a nice
looking fashion). For the rules of the algorithm, please take a look at the
description written in the Week 1 section.

Calling `zellers("March", 10, 1940)` should give the output: `Sunday`.

Hints:

1. Use a dictionary to map between the month and its numerical value.

2. You can use either a list or dictionary to convert the final output of the
   algorithm to the day of the week.

3. Make sure you handle the following three points correctly.

   * Note: If the month is January or February, then the preceding year is
     used for computation. This is because there was a period in history when
     March 1st, not January 1st, was the beginning of the year.

   * If the computed value of R is a negative number, add 7 to get a
     nonnegative number between 0 and 6.

   * You might need to use one of the following (but, maybe not): To convert
     the string '90' to the number 90, use `int('90')`; to convert the int 90 to
     the string '90', use `str(90)`.

## 3.6 Double check

For every problem, check the following:

* Have you put the problem in a function?
* Have you added the problem to the right Python file?
* Have you put your name on top of that file?
* Have you made sure the program is NOT interactive (e.g. we don't have to type anything) except 3.1?
* Have you written at least three tests to show the program is correct, or even more tests if the problem prescribes this?
* Do the tests give the expected output?
