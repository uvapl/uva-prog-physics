# Welcome to week 4!

Today, you'll learn about:

* strings;
* file input/output;

Please prepare for this day using the readings below. They will not always
immediately make sense without practice, but that's no problem. You may want
to re-read them after this practice session!

## Readings

From [*How to think like a computer scientist* (Allen Downey)](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html).

* [7. Strings](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython009.html)
* [14.1-14.5 Files](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython015.html)

## What to turn in

You are to hand in the answers to the exercises, python source files that we
can test, and optionally the Python source for the Hacker edition.

## Deadline

The deadline is today, by 18:00. However, you are required to review your exercises with an assistant before 16:30.
