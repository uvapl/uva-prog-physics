# Welcome to week 3!

Today, you'll learn about three ways to store data in your program.

* Lists, lists and lists.
* Dictionaries.
* Tuples.

Please prepare for this day using the readings below. They will not always
immediately make sense without practice, but that's no problem. You may want
to re-read them after this practice session!

## Readings

From [*How to think like a computer scientist* (Allen Downey)](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html).

* [Lists](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython011.html)
* [Dictionaries](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython012.html)
* [Tuples](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython013.html)

## What to turn in

You are to hand in the answers to the exercises, three python source files
that we can test, and optionally the Python source for the Hacker edition.

## Deadline

The deadline is today, by 18:00. However, you are required to review your
exercises with an assistant before 16:30.
