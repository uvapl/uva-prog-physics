This workshop will kick off your 5th day of Python programming. Today, you'll
learn about everything about functions!

## Preparation

Read and annotate these chapters from your book:

* Chapter 3, Functions
* Chapter 4.8--4.12, Recursion
* Chapter 5, Fruitful functions
* Chapter 7, Strings

Your annotations will be checked and discussed by a teaching assistant. This is
how you should annotate:

* mark any parts of the text that you don't really understand;
* in the margin, write down any questions that pop up.

Don't read too slowly, you do not need to understand it all and you definitely
do not need to memorize. Still, your programming work will finish a lot faster
when you prepare like this.

## What to turn in after you finish programming

You are to hand in the answers to the exercises, three python source code files
that we can test, and optionally one or two python files for the hacker edition.

## Deadline

The deadline is Friday at 18:00. However, you are required to review your
exercises with an assistant at the second day of class.
