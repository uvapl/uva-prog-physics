# Exercises

These exercises will take you on a trip through Python. You are supposed to try out the code in your Python interpreter as often as possible.

## Exercise 1.0 – Installing Python

Follow the instructions on installing Python and IDLE in the **Getting Started** section of the course homepage (click the <i class="icon-home"></i> button). Be sure to install Python version 2.7.x! Ask an assistant for help if you run into any trouble. Before continuing, play around with the Python shell a bit and explore how you can use it as a calculator.

## Exercise 1.1 – Hello, world!

Recall that a program is just a set of instructions for the computer to execute. Let's start with a basic command `print x` which prints the value of the expression `x`, followed by a *newline*.

Create a new program called `hello_world.py`. You will use this file to write your very first 'Hello, world!' program. How to create a program file:

1. Open a new window by choosing **New Window** from the **File** menu.

	![File -> New](file-new.png)

2. Save the file as `hello_world.py`. Do NOT skip the `.py` portion of the file name --- otherwise, you will lose out on syntax highlighting!

	![Filename](filename.png)

3. Start every program with a bank of comments, with a comment line for your name, the name of your file, the day of the week, and today's date. Recall that a comment line begins with a '#' (pound) symbol.

You can now write your very own *Hello, world!* program. This is the first program that most programmers write in a new programming language. In Python, *Hello world!* is a very simple program to write. Do this now... it should be only be one line!

When you are done, save your work and run it. Your code should look similar to this:

![Hello World example](hello-world.png)

To run your program, chose **Run Module** from the **Run** menu (or just hit F5 on Windows/Linux, or fn-F5 on a Mac). When you run the code, your shell should look similar to this:

![Shell Hello World](shell.png)

When you run your code, it first prints the line `>>> ===== RESTART =====`, then runs your code underneath that line. See?

## Exercise 1.2 – Printing

From the course website, download the [homework1.py](homework1.py) template. Remember to put your name and section at the top. If you don't we'll be highly grumpy.

Write a program using print that, when run, prints out a tic-tac-toe board. Remember to save your program regularly, to keep from losing your work! The purpose of this exercise is to make sure you understand how to write programs using your computing environment; many students in introductory courses experience trouble with assignments not because they have trouble with the material, but because of some weird environment quirk.

Expected output:

	  |  |
	--------
	  |  |
	--------
	  |  |

## Exercise 1.3 – Variables

Recall that variables are containers for storing information. For example,

Program Text:

{: .language-python}
	a = "Hello, world!"
	print a

Output:

	Hello, world!

The `=` sign is an assignment operator which tells the interpreter to assign the value `"Hello, world!"` to the variable `a`.

Program Text:

{: .language-python}
	a = "Hello, world!"
	a = "and goodbye..."
	print a
		
Output:

	and goodbye...
		
Taking this second example, the value of a after executing the first line above is `"Hello, world!"`. But, after executing the second line, the value of a changes to `"and goodbye..."`. Since we ask the program to print out a only after the second assignment statement, that is the value that gets printed. If you wanted to save the values of both strings, you should change the second variable to another valid variable name, such as `b`.

Variables are useful because they can cut down on the amount of code you have to write. In your own `homework1.py`, write a program that prints out the tic-tac-toe board from exercise 1.2, but which uses variables to cut down on the amount of typing you have to do. **Hint**: how many different variables should you need?

## Exercise 1.4 – Operators/Order of Operation

Python has the ability to be used as a cheap, 5-dollar calculator. In particular, it supports basic mathematical operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` as well as the power operator `**` and the modulus operator `%`.

Program Text:

{: .language-python}
	x = 5 + 7
	print x
	y = x + 10
	print y

Output:

	12
	22

Note that we can use variables in the definition of other variables! Mathematical operators only work on numbers: `int`s or `float`s. Statements such as `'Hi' + 5` or `'5 + 7` will not work.

**Part I**: Input the following sets of equations, and note the difference between `int` arithmetic and `float` arithmetic. You can do this just in your interpreter (you don't need to turn anything in for this part), but pay attention to the output!
	
1.	$$5/2$$, $$5/2.0$$, and $$5.0/2$$

	Note that as long as one argument is a float, all of your math 
	will be floating point!

2.	$$7 xx (1 / 2)$$ and $$7 xx (1 / 2.0)$$

3.	`5 ∗∗ 2`, `5.0 ∗∗ 2`, and `5 ∗∗ 2.0`

4.	$$1/3.0$$

	Note that the final digit is rounded. Python does this for
	non-terminating decimal numbers, as computers cannot store infinite
	numbers!

**Part II**: In `homework1.py`, transcribe the following equations into Python (without simplifying!), preserving order of operation with parenthesis as needed. Save each as the value of a variable, and then print the variable.

1.	$$(3 xx 5) / (2 + 3)$$

2.	$$sqrt(7 + 9) xx 2$$

3.	$$(4 - 7) ^ 3$$

4.	$$root4(-19+100)$$

5.	$$6 mod 4$$

	If you aren't familiar with modular arithmetic, it is pretty
	straightforward: the modulus operator, in the expression $$x mod y$$,
	gives the remainder when $$x$$ is divided by $$y$$. Try a couple of modular
	expressions until you get the hang of it.

**Part III**: In `homework1.py`, use order of operation mathematics to create two equations that look the same (i.e., have the same numbers) but evaluate to different values (due to parenthesization). Save each as the value of a variable, then print the variables.

## Exercise 1.5 – User input

Do this exercise in `homework1.py`. In this exercise, we will ask the user for his/her first and last name, and date of birth, and print them out formatted. Recall that you can get input from the user using the command `raw_input("text")`, as shown in lecture.

**Note**: There are two functions to get user input. The first, `raw_input`, turns whatever the user inputs into a `string` automatically. The second, `input`, preserves type. So, if the user inputs an `int`, or a `float`, you will get an `int` or a `float` (rather than a `string`). Be careful though: you still want to use raw input if you want a string back, or otherwise the user will have to put quotes around their answer. Use raw input here: it's good for string processing, like this problem. `input` will come in handy when using user input to compute math, like in Exercise 1.8.

Here is an example of what this program should do:

	Enter your first name: Chuck
	Enter your last name: Norris
	Enter your date of birth:
	Month? March
	Day? 10
	Year? 1940
	Chuck Norris was born on March 10, 1940.
		
To print a string and a number in one line, you just need to separate the arguments with a comma (this works for any two types within a print statement). The comma adds a space between the two arguments. For example, the lines:

{: .language-python}
	mo = 'October'
	day = '20'
	year = '1977'
	print mo, day, year

will have the output

	October 20 1977

## Pretty printing

**Optional**: Now, for something completely different... a discussion on how to print strings, most prettily...

Note that none of the commas are in this output! To do that you want something like this:

{: .language-python}
	print mo, day + ',', year

The `+` sign concatenates two strings, but can only be used on two strings. Using it on a number and a string will cause an error (because it is ambiguous as to what you want the program to do!)

That's why it's a great idea to use raw_input for this problem; if you use input you'd have to convert the `int` to a `string`. We'll cover this more in-depth later on, when we get to strings, but you may want to play with string concatenation operations now to get everything to look its prettiest.

## Intermezzo: Questions

At this point, we suggest completing questions 1.9--1.11 to cement your understanding of these topics. Just go to the next tab, answer the questions and return here to code some more.

## Exercise 1.6 – New Operators

Open up IDLE and play around with the new operators showed today in class. Make sure that you understand how to use them and what they are used for! The operators `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` are called *relation* operators. 

They work on all types, not just numbers, and return a `Boolean` (`True`/`False`) value. Remember, if you are using `Boolean`s, to capitalize `True` and `False`! Here's an example shell session; try other examples you can think of.

	>>> 5 >= 7
	False
	>>> 'abc' != 'def'
	True
	>>> x = 'abc'
	>>> x == 'abc'
	True

This next example is strange! Try to understand what’s going on here, and ask if you’re confused.

	>>> a = True
	>>> b = (5 < 7)
	>>> a == b
	True

Next, the operators `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=` change the value of a stored variable in a quicker way. In the following example, we add 6 to a variable in two different ways; note that we get the same result! Try using all of these operators in your interpreter window before moving on.

	>>> x = 5
	>>> x = x + 6
	>>> print x
	11
	>>> y = 5
	>>> y += 6
	>>> print y
	11

## Intermezzo: Questions

We strongly suggest you finish all questions now, before continuing on with the next exercise. Just go to the next tab and return here when you have finished.

## Exercise 1.7 – Rock, Paper, Scissors

In this exercise, you are going to practice using conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`). You will write a small program that will determine the result of a "rock, paper, scissors" game, given Player 1 and Player 2's choices. Your program will print out the result. Here are the rules of the game:

![Rock, paper, scissors](rock.png)

1. First create a truth table for all the possible choices for player 1 and 2, and the outcome of the game. This will help you figure out how to code the game!

   **Protip**: you can fill out the table below in your browser. If you are logged in to the website, your answers will be saved and remembered until the next time you login.

	|Player 1      |Player 2      |Result        |
	|--------------|--------------|--------------|
	|Rock          |Rock          |Tie           |
	|Rock          |Scissors      |Player 1      |
	|<input name="a[1-7-1]" type="text"> |<input name="a[1-7-2]" type="text"> |<input name="a[1-7-3]" type="text"> |
	|<input name="a[1-7-4]" type="text"> |<input name="a[1-7-5]" type="text"> |<input name="a[1-7-6]" type="text"> |
	|<input name="a[1-7-7]" type="text"> |<input name="a[1-7-8]" type="text"> |<input name="a[1-7-9]" type="text"> |
	|<input name="a[1-7-10]" type="text">|<input name="a[1-7-11]" type="text">|<input name="a[1-7-12]" type="text">|
	|<input name="a[1-7-13]" type="text">|<input name="a[1-7-14]" type="text">|<input name="a[1-7-15]" type="text">|
	|<input name="a[1-7-16]" type="text">|<input name="a[1-7-17]" type="text">|<input name="a[1-7-18]" type="text">|
	|<input name="a[1-7-19]" type="text">|<input name="a[1-7-20]" type="text">|<input name="a[1-7-21]" type="text">|

2. Create a new file `rps.py` that will generate the outcome of the rock, scissors, paper game. The program should ask the user for input and display the answer as follows:

		Player 1? rock
		Player 2? scissors
		Player 1 wins.

The only valid inputs are `rock`, `paper`, and `scissors`. If the user enters anything else, your program should output "This is not a valid object selection". Use the truth table you created to help with creating the conditions for your if statement(s).

**Note**: If you have a long condition in your `if` statement, and you want to split it into multiple lines, you can either enclose the entire expression in parenthesis, e.g.

{: .language-python}
	if (player1 == 'rock' and
		player2 == 'scissors'):
		print 'Player 1 wins.'

Or, you can use the *backslash* symbol to indicate to Python that the next line is still part of the previous line of code, e.g.

{: .language-python}
	if player1 == 'rock' and\
		player2 == 'scissors':
		print 'Player 1 wins.'

Use whichever form you feel comfortable using. When you are done coding *and testing*, print a copy of the file and turn it in. Make sure your name and section number is in the comment section of your program.

## Exercise 1.8 – For & While Loops

Create a new file called `loops.py` and use it for all parts of this exercise. Remember the difference between input and raw input? If not, look at Exercise 1.5 again.

Be sure to test your code for each part before moving on to the next part.

1. Using a for loop, write a program that prints out the decimal equivalents of $$1 / 2, 1/3, 1 / 4, ..., 1/10$$.

2. Write a program using a while loop that asks the user for a number, and prints a countdown from that number to zero. What should your program do if the user inputs a negative number? As a programmer, you should always consider "edge conditions" like these when you program! (Another way to put it: always assume the users of your program will be trying to find a way to break it! If you don't include a condition that catches negative numbers, what will your program do?)

3. Write a program using a for loop that calculates exponentials. Your program should ask the user for a base `base` and an exponent `exp`, and calculate `base`<sup>`exp`</sup>. You can't use the `^` operator!

4. Write a program using a while loop that asks the user to enter a number that is divisible by 2. Give the user a witty message if they enter something that is not divisible by 2, *and make them enter a new number*. Don't let them stop until they enter an even number! Print a congratulatory message when they *finally* get it right.

When you are done, make sure you have answers all exercise questions, and submit your files at the submit tab! If you have time left, take a go at the Hacker edition :-)
